# In python : Everything is stored as "Object" in Memory

# Immutalbe : Value ka Reference change nahi ho sakta (can be redirected to other reference(object))
# and auto-matic garbage collector helps to removes the previous value refernece

# Mutable : Value ka reference change ho sakta hai 

# Note : It is not like "'constant'" and "'variable'" 
# Memory ka reference hai
