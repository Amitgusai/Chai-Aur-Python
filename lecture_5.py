# Any or all data ka type in python goes to memory not in the variable
# which is why:
# Python does not have any data type
# But:
# Memory me reference ka data type hota hai And memory me data ka type assign hota hai.

# Example:                          _IMP_
#     a = 5
#     a ka data type kya hai : nothing
#     5 ka data type : Number data type/object type

# refcount: No particular method as such written on some documents

# Python treats Strings and Numbers differently:
#     Late garbage collection in case of String and Numbers for optimization as it can be used further in the program..
